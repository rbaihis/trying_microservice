#          # batch-size best practice:

#              # how should the size be:
#                  #  Based on the average size of a group of messages (batch) and expected throughput.
#                  # (message is too large):
#                      # should consider host instance , before even calculating , monitor then decide
#                  # (regular-class-data-json ): [still should consider the ram of host instance ]
#                      # (low-medium throughput) batch-size fine between  [1/20 - 1/200] of buffer-size
#                      # (high-concurrency and throughput) batch-size should be at least 1/1024 of buffer-size

#              # Network Latency or Broker Issues : the messages can accumulate in the buffer.
